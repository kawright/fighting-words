CHANGELOG

=========================
v0.1-alpha (16 July 2023)
=========================

-   First commit to the new public repository
-   All simple mechanics needed for bare-minimum gameplay have been implemented.
    These include:
        -   Basic rendering routines implemented for tiles, labels, and 
            background elements.
        -   Word matching logic implemented. Matched words successfully clear
            tiles from the play-field.
        -   Basic user input handling implemented. User can move, rotate, and
            drop tile-groups.
